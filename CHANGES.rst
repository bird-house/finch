Changes
*******

0.12.0 (2024-03-25)
===================
* Renamed the installed package from `finch` to `birdhouse-finch`.
* First release of the `birdhouse-finch` package on PyPI.
* Versioning now adheres to SemVer v2.0.0.
* Added a Makefile recipe to the repository to evaluate notebooks while ignoring the output cells.
* Cleaned up documentation to facilitate easier navigation.
* Slightly reorganized the documentation for easier navigation.
* Fast-forwarded the cookiecutter.
* Fixed the ``Manifest.in`` to add all necessary files to wheel.
* Removed references to files that have never existed (`apidoc`).
* Cleaned up the setup code.
* Added more files to be ignored in the `.gitignore` and in the `Manifest.in`.

0.11.4 (2023-12-20)
===================
* Fixed a bug that occurred when fixing a broken cftime-index with newer `cftime` versions.
* Placed pins on xarray and pandas to prevent future errors from changes to frequency codes.

0.11.3 (2023-08-23)
===================
* Updated ReadTheDocs to use the new mambaforge version (`2022.9`).
* Addressed calls in GitHub Action usage that were emitting warnings.
* Updated `MANIFEST.in` to include and exclude the relevant files for the source distribution.
* Modified the `setup.py` to only include the files necessary in the wheel.
* Updated `AUTHORS.rst` to list more contributors.
* Removed namespace file (`__init__.py`) from tests to ensure that they aren't treated like an importable package.
* Updated pre-commit hooks.
* Sorted software requirements for legibility.
* Removed Travis-CI shell script.

0.11.2 (2023-07-27)
===================
* Added a Docker-based testing suite to the GitHub Workflows.
* Added a wider range of Python versions to test against in the GitHub Workflows.
* Migrated conda-build action from mamba-org/provision-with-micromamba to mamba-org/setup-micromamba.
* Cleaned up the Dockerfile. Docker now pip-installs finch directly from the GitHub repository.
* Finch now explicitly supports Python3.11.
* Pinned Python below 3.12 on conda and removed pin on pint for ReadTheDocs builds.
* Added a GitHub Workflow to bump the version number and to create tags from the version bumping process on dispatch.
* Added a pre-commit hook for validating the ReadTheDocs configuration and GitHub Workflows.

0.11.1 (2023-06-19)
===================
* Update to xclim 0.43.0.
* Added xclim yml module support:
    - Added humidex days above calculation via yml module.
    - Reimplmented streamflow indicators via yml module (adjust for xclim 0.41 breaking changes).
* Fixed bug for CanDCS-U6 ensemble "26models" list.
* Passing an empty string to `ensemble_percentiles` in ensemble processes will return the merged un-reduced ensemble. The different members are listed along the `realization` coordinates through raw names allowing for basic distinction between the input members.

0.11.0 (2023-06-13)
===================
* Fixed iter_local when depth > 0 to avoid all files to be considered twice
* Revised documentation configuration on ReadTheDocs to leverage Anaconda (Mambaforge)
* Minor adjustments to dependency configurations
* Removed configuration elements handling from `finch start`. One can still pass custom config files, but all configuration defaults are handled by `finch/default.cfg` and the WSGI function. `jinja2` is not a dependency anymore.

0.10.0 (2022-11-04)
===================
* Generalize ensemble datasets configuration.
    - Datasets usable by ensemble processes are now specified through a YAML file which is pointed to in the configuration.
    - As a consequence processes are generated according to the available variables. Similarly for the allowed values of some inputs on these processes.
    - The output name now includes the dataset name (if a custom name was not specified).
    - ``finch.processes.xclim`` was removed, there is no static module of processes.
    - Input "rcp" has been renamed to "scenario".
    - Input "dataset_name" has been fixed and renamed to "dataset".
* Update to xclim 0.38.0.
* Improved subset_grid_point_dataset & subset_bbox_dataset performance when using local files.

0.9.2 (2022-07-19)
==================
* Fix Finch unable to startup in the Docker image.

0.9.1 (2022-07-07)
==================
* Avoid using a broken version of ``libarchive`` in the Docker image.

0.9.0 (2022-07-06)
==================
* Fix use of ``output_name``, add ``output_format`` to xclim indicators.
* Change all outputs to use ``output`` as the main output field name (instead of ``output_netcdf``).
* Updated to xclim 0.37:

    - Percentile inputs of xclim indicators have been renamed with generic names, excluding an explicit mention to the target percentile.
    - In ensemble processes, these percentiles can now be chosen through ``perc_[var]`` inputs. The default values are inherited from earlier versions of xclim.
* Average shape process downgraded to be single-threaded, as ESMF seems to have issues with multithreading.
* Removed deprecated processes ``subset_ensemble_bbox_BCCAQv2``, ``subset_ensemble_BCCAQv2`` and ``BCCAQv2_heat_wave_frequency_gridpoint``.
* Added ``csv_precision`` to all processes allowing CSV output. When given, it controls the number of decimal places in the output.

0.8.3 (2022-04-21)
==================
* Preserve RCP dimension in ensemble processes, even when only RCP is selected.
* Pin ``dask`` and ``distributed`` at ``2022.1.0``, see https://github.com/Ouranosinc/PAVICS-e2e-workflow-tests/issues/100

0.8.2 (2022-02-07)
==================
* Add ``geoseries_to_netcdf`` process, converting a geojson (like a OGC-API request) to a CF-compliant netCDF.
* Add ``output_name`` argument to most processes (excepted subsetting and averaging processes), to control the name (or prefix) of the output file.
* New dependency ``python-slugify`` to ensure filenames are safe and valid.
* Pinning dask to ``<=2022.1.0`` to avoid a performance issue with ``2022.1.1``.

0.8.0 (2022-01-13)
==================
* Add ``hourly_to_daily`` process, converting hourly data to daily data using a reduction operation (sum, mean, max, min).
* Upgrade to clisops 0.8.0 to accelerate spatial averages over regions.
* Upgrade to xesmf 0.6.2 to fix spatial averaging bug not weighing correctly cells with varing areas.
* Update to PyWPS 4.5.1 to allow the creation of recursive directories for outputs.

Notes
